    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a comforting Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with a rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese mixture, and gooey melted cheese. Each layer of the dish is built with a tomato-based meat sauce (often made with ground beef or sausage), a blend of ricotta or cottage cheese mixed with eggs and herbs, and a sprinkle of mozzarella or Parmesan. The layers are repeated, finishing with a final layer of sauce and cheese, then baked until golden and bubbly. This hearty dish is perfect for family gatherings or a cozy dinner, offering a delicious combination of textures and flavors in every bite.</p>
